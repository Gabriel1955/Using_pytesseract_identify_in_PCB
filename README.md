# Using_pytesseract_identify_in_PCB
in this project we use digital image processing to identify screen printing / components on PCBs

this project is divided into two parts, filtering and character identification

In a moment we study the best way to filter images

In the other moment, with images filtered in the best way, we try to identify the characters in the images
